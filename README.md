You can find if two actors/actress appeared in films together and if yes in which ones (back-end part).

Searching on https://www.rottentomatoes.com/

Front-end part is on matcher: https://github.com/OleksiyMusiyezdov/matcher.

TODO: Refactor and other improvements (like more complex data search and output, error handling) needed.

To run the program you need to have both front-end and back-end parts (side-by-side folders) installed and in front-end part folder ("matcher") type "npm start" - everything will run on localhost.
